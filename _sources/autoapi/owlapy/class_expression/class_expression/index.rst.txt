.. py:class:: OWLClassExpression

   Bases: :py:obj:`owlapy.owl_data_ranges.OWLPropertyRange`


   OWL Class expressions represent sets of individuals by formally specifying conditions on the individuals' properties;
   individuals satisfying these conditions are said to be instances of the respective class expressions.
   In the structural specification of OWL 2, class expressions are represented by ClassExpression.

   .. py:attribute:: __slots__
      :value: ()



   .. py:method:: is_owl_thing() -> bool
      :abstractmethod:


      Determines if this expression is the built in class owl:Thing. This method does not determine if the class
      is equivalent to owl:Thing.

      :returns: Thing.
      :rtype: True if this expression is owl



   .. py:method:: is_owl_nothing() -> bool
      :abstractmethod:


      Determines if this expression is the built in class owl:Nothing. This method does not determine if the class
      is equivalent to owl:Nothing.



   .. py:method:: get_object_complement_of() -> OWLObjectComplementOf
      :abstractmethod:


      Gets the object complement of this class expression.

      :returns: A class expression that is the complement of this class expression.



   .. py:method:: get_nnf() -> OWLClassExpression
      :abstractmethod:


      Gets the negation normal form of the complement of this expression.

      :returns: A expression that represents the NNF of the complement of this expression.



.. py:class:: OWLAnonymousClassExpression

   Bases: :py:obj:`OWLClassExpression`


   A Class Expression which is not a named Class.


   .. py:method:: is_owl_nothing() -> bool

      Determines if this expression is the built in class owl:Nothing. This method does not determine if the class
      is equivalent to owl:Nothing.



   .. py:method:: is_owl_thing() -> bool

      Determines if this expression is the built in class owl:Thing. This method does not determine if the class
      is equivalent to owl:Thing.

      :returns: Thing.
      :rtype: True if this expression is owl



   .. py:method:: get_object_complement_of() -> OWLObjectComplementOf

      Gets the object complement of this class expression.

      :returns: A class expression that is the complement of this class expression.



   .. py:method:: get_nnf() -> OWLClassExpression

      Gets the negation normal form of the complement of this expression.

      :returns: A expression that represents the NNF of the complement of this expression.



.. py:class:: OWLBooleanClassExpression

   Bases: :py:obj:`OWLAnonymousClassExpression`


   Represent an anonymous boolean class expression.


   .. py:attribute:: __slots__
      :value: ()



.. py:class:: OWLObjectComplementOf(op: OWLClassExpression)

   Bases: :py:obj:`OWLBooleanClassExpression`, :py:obj:`owlapy.meta_classes.HasOperands`\ [\ :py:obj:`OWLClassExpression`\ ]


   A complement class expression ObjectComplementOf( CE ) contains all individuals that are not instances of the
   class expression CE.
   (https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Complement_of_Class_Expressions)


   .. py:attribute:: __slots__
      :value: '_operand'



   .. py:attribute:: type_index
      :type:  Final
      :value: 3003



   .. py:method:: get_operand() -> OWLClassExpression

      :returns: The wrapped expression.



   .. py:method:: operands() -> Iterable[OWLClassExpression]

      Gets the operands - e.g., the individuals in a sameAs axiom, or the classes in an equivalent
      classes axiom.

      :returns: The operands.



   .. py:method:: __repr__()


   .. py:method:: __eq__(other)


   .. py:method:: __hash__()
