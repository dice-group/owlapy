.. py:function:: init(the_class)

   Since classes names in owlapi and owlapy are pretty much similar with the small difference that in owlapi they
   usually have the 'Impl' part then we can create the mapping class name dynamically reducing the amount of code
   significantly. That's what this method does.


.. py:class:: OWLAPIMapper

   A bridge between owlapy and owlapi owl-related classes.


   .. py:method:: map_(e)

      (owlapy <--> owlapi) entity mapping.

      :param e: OWL entity/expression.



   .. py:method:: to_list(stream_obj)
      :staticmethod:


      Converts Java Stream object to Python list
