      Notes:
      ------
      - The function supports saving in multiple formats: Turtle, RDF/XML, and OWL/XML.
      - The inferred axioms are generated using the reasoner associated with this instance and the OWL API's

      Example:
      --------
      >>> instance.generate_inferred_class_assertion_axioms(output="inferred_axioms.ttl", format="ttl")
      This will save the inferred class assertion axioms to the file "inferred_axioms.ttl" in Turtle format.
