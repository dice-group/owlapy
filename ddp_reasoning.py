Distributed OWL DL Instance Retrieval over Horizontally Sharded Ontologies
==========================================================================

Additional dependency: ``pip install ray``

Overview
--------
This module implements distributed OWL DL instance retrieval — the task of
computing the extension ``C^I`` of an OWL class expression ``C`` over an
interpretation ``I`` induced by a partitioned ontology ``O = (T, A)`` — using
`Ray <https://docs.ray.io/>`_ as the distributed computing backend and
`owlapy <https://github.com/dice-group/owlapy>`_ for OWL DL reasoning.

Ontology partitioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Given an ontology ``O = (T, A)`` with TBox ``T`` and ABox ``A``:

* **TBox replication** — ``T`` is copied in full to every shard.  This
  includes the class hierarchy, object-property characteristics (transitivity,
  symmetry, etc.), domain/range axioms, General Concept Inclusions (GCIs), and
  ``owl:AllDifferent`` axioms.
* **ABox partitioning** — ``A`` is split into ``N`` disjoint subsets
  ``A_0, …, A_{N-1}`` by round-robin assignment over *subject* individuals.
  Let ``h: Ind → {0, …, N-1}`` be the hash function.  Then:

  - Every class assertion ``C(a)`` is placed in ``A_{h(a)}``.
  - Every object-property assertion ``r(s, o)`` is placed in ``A_{h(s)}``.

  Shard ``i`` loads ontology ``O_i = (T, A_i)``.  Crucially, property
  assertions are keyed by the *subject*, not the object.  This design
  guarantees that all of a subject's property assertions are co-located.

Two distributed reasoning strategies are provided:

* **BaseShardReasoner** (CWA) — the coordinator recursively decomposes the
  query CE into atomic sub-queries by dispatching on CE type via
  ``singledispatchmethod``.  Atomic data (class instances, property maps) is
  gathered from all shards in parallel; the coordinator performs
  set-algebraic aggregation (union, intersection, set-difference) locally.
  Cardinality restrictions are resolved by counting **IRI-distinct** role
  fillers across shards (Closed-World / Unique-Name assumption).

* **ShardEnsembleReasoner** (OWA, recommended) — each shard evaluates the
  CE *and every sub-CE* locally via Pellet, returning per-node intermediate
  results.  The coordinator combines them **bottom-up** by CE type.
  CE types that suffer from cross-shard visibility issues (existential
  restrictions, nominals, ``≥1`` cardinality) are resolved with dedicated
  cross-shard joins; all other CE types are combined by simple union of
  per-shard results.  This strategy is **sound under OWA** and has been
  empirically validated at Jaccard 1.0 / F1 1.0 on 12 178 class expressions
  across 20 shards of the Mutagenesis benchmark.

Cross-shard inference problem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``r(s, o)`` is in shard ``h(s)``; ``C(o)`` is in shard ``h(o)``.  When
``h(s) ≠ h(o)``, per-shard Pellet evaluation of ``∃ r.C`` on either shard
alone is **incomplete**: shard ``h(s)`` does not know ``C(o)``, and shard
``h(o)`` does not contain ``s``.  ``ShardEnsembleReasoner`` resolves this by
first combining the filler set ``C^I`` globally across shards, then passing it
to every shard for a lightweight ABox scan of local property assertions.
See the class docstring of ``ShardEnsembleReasoner`` for the complete CE-type
routing table and formal correctness arguments.

  ShardReasoner (Ray actor, one per shard)
      Wraps a SyncReasoner (Pellet / HermiT) for a single shard.
      Returns plain IRI strings to avoid Java/Python serialisation issues.
      Exposes two query entry-points:
        - ``query_instances`` (full CE, used by BaseShardReasoner open-world mode)
        - ``query_instances_with_intermediate`` (CE + all sub-CEs, used by
          ShardEnsembleReasoner for bottom-up combining)
      Plus relational helpers for cross-shard joins:
        - ``get_object_property_subjects``  (existential join primitive)
        - ``get_object_property_map``       (CWA cardinality counting)

  BaseShardReasoner (coordinator, CWA, runs on driver)
      Recursive CE decomposition via singledispatchmethod.
      Supported constructors: OWLClass, OWLObjectIntersectionOf,
      OWLObjectUnionOf, OWLObjectSomeValuesFrom, OWLObjectAllValuesFrom,
      OWLObjectComplementOf, OWLObjectHasValue, OWLObjectOneOf,
      OWLObjectMinCardinality, OWLObjectMaxCardinality, OWLObjectExactCardinality.

  ShardEnsembleReasoner (coordinator, OWA, runs on driver)
      Extends BaseShardReasoner. Bottom-up combining of per-shard intermediate
      results with cross-shard joins for ∃ r.C, ≥1 r.C, and nominals.
      See class docstring for the complete CE-type routing table.

  shard_ontology (utility, from shard_ontology.py)
      Splits O = (T, A) into N shard ontologies. TBox replicated; ABox
      partitioned round-robin.

Usage
-----
::

  # Fully automatic — no terminal setup needed:
  python ddp_reasoning.py --auto_ray --num_shards 8

  # Use a different ontology / namespace:
  python ddp_reasoning.py --auto_ray --num_shards 4 \\
      --base /path/to/KG --ns http://example.org/myonto# \\
      --reasoner HermiT

  # Manual Ray cluster (start Ray head node first in a separate terminal):
  #   ray start --head --port=6379 \\
  #       --resources='{"shard_0":1,"shard_1":1,"shard_2":1,"shard_3":1}'
  python ddp_reasoning.py --num_shards 4

CLI Arguments
-------------
  --base          Base directory that contains the ontology and shard files.
  --ontology      Explicit path to the source ontology
                  (default: <base>/<stem>.owl, inferred from --base).
  --num_shards    Number of shards / Ray workers  (default: 1).
  --ns            Namespace URI prefix for the ontology  (default: Mutagenesis).
  --reasoner      OWL reasoner backend: Pellet (default) or HermiT.
  --auto_ray      When set, Ray is initialised in-process using all available
                  CPU cores and the required shard custom resources.

Distributed Setup (multi-machine)
----------------------------------
Each physical machine runs ``ray start``.  The head node registers
``shard_0``; every additional worker registers its own shard resource.
The driver script can run from any machine that can reach the head.

::

  # 4 machines (1 shard each):
  Machine 1: ray start --head --port=6379 --resources='{"shard_0": 1}'
  Machine 2: ray start --address='<HEAD_IP>:6379' --resources='{"shard_1": 1}'
  Machine 3: ray start --address='<HEAD_IP>:6379' --resources='{"shard_2": 1}'
  Machine 4: ray start --address='<HEAD_IP>:6379' --resources='{"shard_3": 1}'
  Driver:    python ddp_reasoning.py --num_shards 4

  # Multiple shards per machine:
  Machine 1: ray start --head --port=6379 \\
                 --resources='{"shard_0":1,"shard_1":1,"shard_2":1,"shard_3":1}'
  Driver:    python ddp_reasoning.py --num_shards 4

OWA vs CWA considerations
-------------------------
Under the **Open-World Assumption** (OWA), a reasoner cannot conclude that two
individuals are distinct unless an ``owl:AllDifferent`` axiom (or equivalent)
explicitly states so.  This has practical consequences for cardinality
restrictions:

* ``≥n r.C`` with ``n ≥ 2`` — Pellet can only return a subject if it can
  prove that at least ``n`` *distinct* fillers exist.  Without AllDifferent
  axioms the result is typically empty, even when the ABox contains many
  role fillers with different IRIs.
* ``≥1 r.C`` — only one qualifying filler is needed; no distinctness proof
  is required.  This is semantically equivalent to ``∃ r.C``.
* ``≤n r.C`` / ``=n r.C`` — similarly sensitive to AllDifferent axioms.

``ShardEnsembleReasoner`` respects these OWA semantics.  It delegates
cardinality evaluation (≥n with n≥2, ≤n, =n) to per-shard Pellet and unions
the results, which preserves the same answers as a single Pellet instance on
the complete ontology.  Only ``≥1 r.C`` receives the cross-shard existential
join treatment (identical to ``∃ r.C``).

``BaseShardReasoner`` operates under CWA: it counts distinct IRI role
fillers across shards, which can over-count when the ontology lacks
AllDifferent axioms.  Use ``ShardEnsembleReasoner`` when OWA-correct answers are
required.


Regression testing
------------------
Any code change should be tested with the following command to ensure that
distributed reasoning results remain consistent::

  python ddp_reasoning_eval.py --auto_ray --num_shards 20 \\
      --path_kg KGs/Mutagenesis/mutagenesis.owl \\
      --cross_shard --open_world --no_negations

Expected result: Jaccard 1.0 / F1 1.0 on all 12 178 class expressions.

class ShardReasoner:
    """
    Ray actor wrapping an OWL DL reasoner (owlapy ``SyncReasoner``) for a
    single horizontal ABox partition (shard).

    Each ``ShardReasoner`` is a stateful Ray actor that loads one shard
    ontology and exposes query methods callable via Ray remote procedure
    calls.  The actor is pinned to a dedicated Ray custom resource
    (``shard_<i>``) to support data-local scheduling on multi-node clusters.

    Data model
    ----------
    Let O = (T, A) be the source ontology with TBox T and ABox A.
    The sharding procedure (``shard_ontology``) produces N shard ontologies
    O_0, ..., O_{N-1} where:

    * **TBox replication** — every shard contains a complete copy of T,
      including class hierarchy, property characteristics, domain/range
      restrictions, GCIs, and ``owl:AllDifferent`` axioms.
    * **ABox partitioning** — A is split into N disjoint subsets
      A_0, ..., A_{N-1} by round-robin assignment over subject individuals.
      Formally,  A = A_0 ⊔ A_1 ⊔ ... ⊔ A_{N-1}  (disjoint union).
    * **Subject-keyed placement** — every class assertion ``C(a)`` is in
      A_{h(a)}, and every object-property assertion ``r(s, o)`` is in
      A_{h(s)}, where h is the round-robin hash function.  Crucially,
      property assertions are keyed by the *subject*, not the object.

    Shard i therefore loads  O_i = (T, A_i).

    Serialisation
    -------------
    All public methods return **plain IRI strings** (``Set[str]`` or
    ``Dict[str, Set[str]]``) rather than ``OWLNamedIndividual`` objects.
    This design avoids Java/Python serialisation issues across the Ray
    object store and eliminates identity/equality mismatches between
    objects created in different JVM sessions.

    API and method dispatch
    -----------------------
    The following table summarises the public query methods exposed by each
    ``ShardReasoner`` actor, what they return, and which coordinator class
    invokes them.  Together these six methods form the complete interface
    through which the distributed coordinators interact with shard actors.

    Data locality invariant
    -----------------------
    Because object-property assertions are keyed by subject, calling
    ``get_object_property_subjects`` on *all* N shards with a globally
    resolved object set guarantees completeness: every subject ``s`` with at
    least one qualifying ``(s, r, o)`` triple is found in ``s``'s assigned
    shard.  No cross-shard communication between actors is required — the
    coordinator performs all joins on the driver.

        Evaluate ``∀ r.C`` with cross-shard filler enrichment.

        Per-shard Pellet evaluation of ``∀ r.C`` is **incomplete** when a filler
        object ``o`` has its ``C(o)`` class assertion on a different shard from the
        subject ``s``.  The shard of ``s`` contains ``r(s, o)`` (subject-keyed
        partitioning) but cannot verify ``C(o)`` without the cross-shard assertion.

        This method resolves the issue by constructing ``∀ r.OneOf(global_C)``
        and evaluating it on the local reasoner.  The ``OneOf`` nominal explicitly
        names all globally confirmed ``C`` members, so Pellet can verify filler
        membership without cross-shard class assertions.  TBox reasoning
        (functional properties, cardinality restrictions, etc.) is handled
        correctly by Pellet as before.

        .. note::

           We use ``∀ r.OneOf(global_C)`` rather than ``∀ r.(C ⊔ OneOf(global_C))``
           because Pellet's ``getInstances`` has a known limitation with unions of
           named classes and nominals (it can return empty for ``C ⊔ {b}`` even
           when ``{b}`` alone correctly returns ``{b}``).  Using just the nominal
           avoids this issue.  The coordinator unions these results with the
           per-shard ``∀ r.C`` Pellet results to preserve TBox-only inferences
           (e.g., GCIs like ``A ⊑ ∀ r.C``).

        **Correctness argument:**

        Let ``C^I`` be the globally resolved extension of ``C`` over the complete
        ontology.  ``OneOf(C^I)`` has exactly the same extension as ``C`` for
        named individuals.  On this shard:

        * All of ``s``'s property assertions are locally available (subject-keyed).
        * The TBox is fully replicated.
        * The reasoner checks whether all of ``s``'s ``r``-fillers are in
          ``OneOf(C^I)`` and whether the TBox permits unknown additional fillers.

        This evaluation is sound: if ``s ∈ ∀ r.OneOf(C^I)`` on this shard, then
        ``s ∈ ∀ r.C`` on the complete ontology (same fillers, same extension,
        same TBox).  The coordinator unions with per-shard ``∀ r.C`` results
        for completeness of TBox-only inferences.

class BaseShardReasoner:
    """
    Coordinator that performs distributed OWL instance retrieval by recursively
    decomposing class expressions (CEs) into atomic sub-queries, dispatching
    them to ``ShardReasoner`` actors, and aggregating per-shard results under
    the **Closed-World Assumption** (CWA).

    The CWA implies the **Unique Name Assumption** (UNA): distinct IRIs denote
    distinct domain individuals.  This is correct when the ontology includes
    ``owl:AllDifferent`` axioms or when the UNA holds by convention.  Without
    such axioms, CWA cardinality counting may diverge from OWA semantics —
    ``≥n r.C`` can **over-count** (IRI-distinct fillers treated as distinct
    individuals) and ``≤n r.C`` / ``=n r.C`` can **under-count** accordingly.
    For OWA-correct reasoning, use ``ShardEnsembleReasoner`` instead.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    Given a class expression CE:

    1. **Recursive decomposition** — ``singledispatchmethod`` dispatches on
       the Python type of CE.  Each handler resolves its sub-expressions
       recursively, gathers atomic data from all shards in parallel via Ray,
       and applies the appropriate set-algebraic operation.
    2. **Atomic shard queries** — leaf-level data (class instances, universe
       set, property maps) is fetched from ``ShardReasoner`` actors in
       parallel using Ray futures.
    3. **Set-algebraic aggregation** — the coordinator joins results using
       union (⊎), intersection (∩), or set-difference (\\) depending on the
       CE constructor.

    Correctness under CWA
    ---------------------
    Under CWA, the recursive decomposition is **sound and complete** for all
    supported CE constructors.  The three key invariants are:

    * **Subject-keyed partitioning** — all property assertions ``r(s, o)``
      are in subject ``s``'s shard, so the merged property map is globally
      complete and existential joins find every qualifying subject.
    * **Disjoint ABox partitioning** — each individual appears in exactly
      one shard, so the union of per-shard class instances is the complete
      set.
    * **TBox replication** — every shard sees the same class hierarchy,
      property characteristics, and GCI axioms, so per-shard entailments
      are consistent.

    The CWA counting of cardinality restrictions treats distinct IRIs as
    distinct individuals.  This coincides with OWA semantics only when
    ``owl:AllDifferent`` axioms are present.

    Note
    ----
    When ``open_world=True``, the recursive decomposition is bypassed: the
    full CE is broadcast to each shard and results are unioned.  This preserves
    per-shard Pellet’s OWA answers but suffers from cross-shard visibility
    issues for existentials, nominals, and Boolean combinations thereof.
    ``ShardEnsembleReasoner`` is the recommended approach for correct OWA
    distributed reasoning.

    """
    Distributed OWL DL reasoner that achieves correct cross-shard instance
    retrieval under the **Open-World Assumption** (OWA) by combining per-shard
    intermediate results in a bottom-up post-processing pass.

    This is the **recommended reasoner** for production use.  It is sound with
    respect to the semantics of each supported OWL CE constructor and has been
    validated at Jaccard 1.0 on 12 178 class expressions across 20 shards of
    the Mutagenesis ontology (see module docstring for full results).

    Cross-shard inference problem
    ----------------------------
    The ABox is partitioned round-robin by subject individual across N shards;
    the TBox is replicated in every shard (“horizontal partitioning”).
    Concretely:

    * A named individual ``a`` has its class-assertion axioms *only* in its
      assigned shard ``shard_{h(a)}``.
    * An object-property assertion ``r(s, o)`` lives in the shard of the
      *subject* ``s``, which may differ from the shard that holds the class
      assertions for the *object* ``o``.

    Therefore, per-shard OWL DL reasoning on complex CEs can be **incomplete**.
    Consider ``∃ r.C``: the shard of ``s`` contains the triple ``(s, r, o)``
    but may lack the class assertion ``C(o)`` (which is in ``o``’s shard),
    while ``o``’s shard lacks the triple entirely.  Neither shard alone can
    confirm ``s ∈ ∃ r.C``.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    ``ShardEnsembleReasoner`` resolves cross-shard visibility with a
    three-phase protocol:

    1. **Scatter** — broadcast ``query_instances_with_intermediate(CE)`` to
       every shard in parallel.  Each shard evaluates the CE *and every
       sub-CE* locally via Pellet (or HermiT), returning a dictionary
       ``{str(sub_ce) → Set[IRI]}`` of intermediate results for all nodes
       in the CE syntax tree.

    2. **Bottom-up combine** — the coordinator walks the CE syntax tree from
       leaves to root.  For each sub-expression, it applies a
       type-specific combining strategy (see table below).  Most CE types
       only need a union of per-shard results; two types (∃ r.C and
       ≥1 r.C) require an additional cross-shard join using the globally
       resolved filler set.

    3. **Cross-shard join** (for ∃ r.C and ≥1 r.C only) — the coordinator
       passes the already-combined filler set ``F = combined[str(C)]`` to
       ``get_object_property_subjects(r, F)`` on every shard.  Each shard
       scans its local property assertions and returns subject IRIs that
       have at least one qualifying filler.  The union of these per-shard
       subject sets is the correct global answer.

    CE-type routing table
    ---------------------
    Each row specifies how the coordinator combines per-shard Pellet results
    for a particular OWL CE constructor, and *why* that strategy is correct
    given the subject-keyed ABox partitioning.

    Worked example: cross-shard ∃ r.C
    ---------------------------------
    Consider N = 8 shards and the Mutagenesis ontology with query
    ``∃ hasBond.{bond17}``:

    * Shard-1 contains: ``hasBond(compound42, bond17)``  (property assertion)
    * Shard-7 contains: ``Bond-1(bond17)``               (class assertion)

    Naive per-shard Pellet evaluation:

    * Shard-1 returns {} — ``bond17`` has no class assertions there, so Pellet
      cannot confirm that ``bond17`` belongs to the filler.
    * Shard-7 returns {} — ``compound42`` is not in Shard-7, so no triple
      ``hasBond(compound42, bond17)`` exists there.

    ShardEnsembleReasoner bottom-up combining:

    1. **OWLObjectOneOf({bond17})** → extract IRIs directly: ``{bond17}`` ✓
    2. **OWLObjectSomeValuesFrom(hasBond, {bond17})** → cross-shard join:
       call ``get_object_property_subjects(hasBond, {bond17})`` on all shards.
       Shard-1 scans its local triples and finds ``hasBond(compound42, bond17)``
       → returns ``{compound42}``.
    3. **Result**: ``{compound42}`` ✓

    Worked example: nested ∃ r1.(∃ r2.C)
    -------------------------------------
    Shard-1: ``r1(o1, o2)``     Shard-2: ``r2(o2, o3)``     Shard-3: ``C(o3)``

    Bottom-up:

    1. ``combined[C]    = {o3}``            (union of per-shard ``C`` results)
    2. ``combined[∃ r2.C] = {o2}``          (cross-shard join: Shard-2 has
       ``r2(o2, o3)`` and ``o3 ∈ {o3}``)
    3. ``combined[∃ r1.(∃ r2.C)] = {o1}``  (cross-shard join: Shard-1 has
       ``r1(o1, o2)`` and ``o2 ∈ {o2}``)

    Result: ``{o1}`` ✓

    Soundness under OWA
    -------------------
    ``ShardEnsembleReasoner`` always operates under the Open-World Assumption.
    * **Union-based CE types** (named classes, Boolean combinators,
      ¬C) — per-shard Pellet evaluates each CE using the shard’s
      local ABox + replicated TBox.  Because class assertions and property
      assertions for any given subject are co-located in one shard, Pellet’s
      per-individual answer is the same as on the full ontology.  The union
      across shards recovers the complete answer.

    * **Cross-shard universal CE types** (∀ r.C) — the coordinator resolves
      the filler set ``C^I`` globally first, then constructs an enriched CE
      ``∀ r.(C ⊔ OneOf(C^I))`` and evaluates it on every shard.  The
      nominal allows Pellet to verify filler membership without cross-shard
      class assertions while still performing correct TBox reasoning for
      unknown-filler checks (functional properties, cardinality, etc.).

    * **Cross-shard join CE types** (∃ r.C, ≥1 r.C) — the coordinator
      resolves the filler set globally first, then performs a lightweight
      ABox scan on every shard.  This is sound because the scan uses
      ``object_property_values`` (which includes inferred triples via
      property chains), and subject-keyed partitioning guarantees that
      every ``(s, r, o)`` triple is checked in exactly the shard of ``s``.

    * **Cross-shard cardinality** (≥n r.C with n≥2) — the coordinator
      resolves the filler set globally from the bottom-up combined results,
      gathers the global property map from all shards, and counts
      IRI-distinct qualifying fillers per subject.  This is necessary
      because per-shard Pellet cannot see filler type assertions ``C(o)``
      that reside on other shards.  Correct under UNA or with
      ``owl:AllDifferent`` axioms.

    * **Per-shard union cardinality** (≤n r.C, =n r.C) — per-shard Pellet
      results are unioned.  CWA IRI-distinct counting would over-exclude
      subjects under OWA (Pellet cannot prove distinctness without
      ``owl:AllDifferent``), so per-shard evaluation is used instead.

    * **Nominals** ({a, b, c}) — extracted directly from the CE; no
      entailment is needed, so correctness is trivial.

           shards in parallel.  Each shard returns a dict

           actual Python CE objects (needed to dispatch on type).
        3. **Bottom-up combine** — sort CE objects by depth (leaves first), then
           for each CE apply the routing strategy from the class docstring table:

           * ``OWLObjectOneOf``          → extract IRIs directly from the CE.
           * ``OWLObjectSomeValuesFrom`` → cross-shard join via
             ``_combine_existential_across_shards``.
           * ``OWLObjectMinCardinality`` with n=1 → cross-shard existential
             join (≥1 r.C ≡ ∃ r.C).
           * ``OWLObjectMinCardinality`` with n≥2 → cross-shard cardinality
             resolution via ``_combine_cardinality_across_shards`` (globally
             resolved filler set + global property map + IRI-distinct counting).
           * ``OWLObjectMaxCardinality``, ``OWLObjectExactCardinality`` →

        Problem
        -------
        Per-shard Pellet evaluation of cardinality restrictions is **incomplete**
        when the filler type assertions live on different shards from the subject.
        For example, ``r(s, o)`` is in shard ``h(s)`` but ``C(o)`` is in shard
        ``h(o)``; Pellet on ``h(s)`` cannot confirm ``o`` is of type ``C``, so it
        under-counts qualifying fillers for ``>=n`` and over-counts for ``<=n``.

        Algorithm
        ---------
        1. Retrieve ``filler_iris = combined[str(filler)]`` — the globally resolved
           filler set, already computed bottom-up.
        2. Gather the global property map for ``r`` from all shards via
           ``_gather_property_maps``.  Subject-keyed partitioning guarantees that
           each subject's property assertions are in exactly one shard, so the
           merged map is globally complete.
        3. For each individual in the universe, count qualifying fillers:
           ``|r(s) ∩ filler_iris|``  (IRI-distinct count).
        4. Apply the min/max constraint from the CE.

        .. note::

           This method counts IRI-distinct fillers as distinct individuals
           (Unique Name Assumption).  Under OWA, this is correct when
           ``owl:AllDifferent`` axioms cover the relevant individuals.  Without
           such axioms, ``>=n`` (n >= 2) may over-count and ``<=n`` / ``=n`` may
           under-count compared to single-Pellet OWA reasoning.

        Algorithm
        ---------
        1. Retrieve ``filler_iris = combined[str(C)]`` — the cross-shard instance
           set for the filler C, already computed bottom-up by the caller.  This
           set may contain individuals from *any* shard.
        2. Call ``get_object_property_subjects(r, filler_iris)`` on every shard in
           parallel.  Each shard scans its local property assertions and returns
           any subject ``s`` such that ``(s, r, o)`` exists for some
           ``o ∈ filler_iris``.
        3. Union the per-shard subject sets.

        Why this is necessary
        ---------------------
        The ABox is partitioned by subject, so the triple ``(s, r, o)`` lives in
        ``s``-shard.  When the filler instances come from a *different* shard than
        the subjects, per-shard Pellet evaluation of the full CE misses them:
        ``s``-shard does not know ``o`` exists (no class assertion there), and
        ``o``-shard does not contain ``s``.

        By passing the already-resolved ``filler_iris`` to every shard,
        ``get_object_property_subjects`` only needs to look at local property
        assertions — a lightweight ABox scan without calling the reasoner.

        Supports nested queries, e.g.:
          Shard-1: (o1, r1, o2)    Shard-2: (o2, r2, o3)
          Query:   ∃ r1.(∃ r2.{o3})
          Step 1:  combined[∃ r2.{o3}] = {o2}   (computed in prior iteration)
          Step 2:  get_object_property_subjects(r1, {o2}) on Shard-1 → {o1}

        Problem
        -------
        Per-shard Pellet evaluation of ``∀ r.C`` is **incomplete** when filler
        class assertions reside on different shards from the subject.  Concretely,
        ``r(s, o)`` is in shard ``h(s)`` but ``C(o)`` is in shard ``h(o)``.  When
        ``h(s) ≠ h(o)``, Pellet on ``h(s)`` cannot verify ``C(o)`` and therefore
        cannot confirm ``s ∈ ∀ r.C``.

        Algorithm
        ---------
        1. Retrieve ``filler_iris = combined[str(C)]`` — the globally resolved filler
           set, already computed bottom-up.
        2. Construct ``∀ r.OneOf(filler_iris)`` on each shard.  The ``OWLObjectOneOf``
           nominal explicitly names every globally confirmed C member, so Pellet on
           each shard can verify filler membership without cross-shard class
           assertions.

           .. note::

              We use ``∀ r.OneOf(C^I)`` rather than ``∀ r.(C ⊔ OneOf(C^I))``
              because Pellet's ``getInstances`` has a known limitation with unions
              of named classes and nominals (returns ∅ for ``C ⊔ {b}`` even when
              ``{b}`` alone correctly returns ``{b}``).

        3. Call ``evaluate_forall_enriched(∀ r.C, filler_iris)`` on all shards in
           parallel.
        4. Union the enriched results with per-shard Pellet results for ``∀ r.C``.
           The per-shard results preserve TBox-only inferences (e.g., GCIs like
           ``A ⊑ ∀ r.C``) that would not fire for the nominal-based enriched CE.

        Correctness under OWA
        ---------------------
        ``OneOf(C^I)`` has the same extension as ``C`` for named individuals (since
        ``C^I`` is the globally resolved extension of ``C`` across all shards).
        All of ``s``'s property assertions are co-located in ``s``'s shard
        (subject-keyed partitioning), and the TBox is replicated.

        * **Enriched results** (``∀ r.OneOf(C^I)``): Pellet correctly verifies that
          all of ``s``'s ``r``-fillers are in ``OneOf(C^I)`` and that the TBox does
          not admit unknown non-``C`` fillers.  Sound because ``OneOf(C^I)`` has the
          same extension as ``C``.
        * **Per-shard Pellet results** (``∀ r.C``): Catches TBox-only inferences
          that reference the named class ``C`` (e.g., GCIs, equivalent-class axioms).
          Sound because Pellet is sound per-shard.
        * **Union**: The union of two sound sets is sound.  No false positives.

        When ``filler_iris`` is empty, the method falls back to a plain union of
        per-shard Pellet results (no enrichment needed).
