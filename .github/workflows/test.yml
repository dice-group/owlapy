# Removed because of an error is generated when trying to create the report.
# It happens because of some pytorch conflict. One of our tests namely test_z_do_last_ebr_retrieval.py uses pytorch
# (also via dicee but the exact root is unknown) and it deletes the tmp files before the coverage can access it.
# In case of update of coverage report (on new releases) just do it manually (run it locally). Ignore the troublesome test.
