"""
Entities are the fundamental building blocks of OWL 2 ontologies, and they define the vocabulary — the named terms — of an ontology.
In logic, the set of entities is usually said to constitute the signature of an ontology.

Classes, datatypes, object properties, data properties, annotation properties, and named individuals
are entities, and they are all uniquely identified by an IR.
