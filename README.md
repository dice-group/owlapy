# owlapy
**Version: 0.1.0**

Owlapy is loosely based on owlapi, successfully representing the main
owl objects in python. 

Other than that, Owlapy also offers some extra functionalities:
- `Owl2SparqlConverter` to convert owl class expressions to SPARQL syntax. 
- `DLSyntaxObjectRenderer` to render owl objects to description logics.
- `ManchesterOWLSyntaxParser` to parse strings of manchester syntax to owl class expression.

For more, please feel free to explore the project for yourself which is made
easier due to the well documented code.


## Installation

```shell
pip install owlapy
```
